==== AT89FLASH ====

* ABSTRACT

This is a command line tool to read and write the flash memory contents
and modify settings of Atmel 80C51 microcontrollers with UART bootloader.
It's a lightweight alternative to Atmel's official flashing tool "Flip".

* INSTALLATION

The program should compile in any UNIX based gcc/glibc environment with
the included Makefile. It merely makes use of standard C and UNIX functions
so no additional libraries will be needed.

* COMPATIBILITY

So far, the program has been tested with AT89C51AC3 and AT98C51CC03 chips.
It might work with other, similar controllers, probably with small changes.
Any reports about the compatibiliy with other MCUs are welcome!
