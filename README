==== AT89FLASH ====

* ABSTRACT

This is a command line tool to read and write the flash memory contents
and modify settings of Atmel 80C51 microcontrollers with UART bootloader.
It's a lightweight alternative to Atmel's official flashing tool "Flip".

* INSTALLATION

The program should compile in any UNIX based gcc/glibc environment with
the included Makefile. It merely makes use of standard C and UNIX functions
so no additional libraries will be needed.
